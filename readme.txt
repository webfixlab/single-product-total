Quickest and lightest way to show total price on product pages. A simple step for a better UX.

== Description ==

With our plugin, you can easily display the total price on the product page. This will help your customers to quickly understand the cost of the product they're interested in, based on the quantity they need.

The plugin supports single, variable and grouped products. It also offers extensive styling options to match your storeâ€™s design. With the **animation duration** feature, you can adjust price calculation time and with enough time, it will automatically handle **Discount plugins**.

Additionally, an add to cart button can be placed in fixed positions, such as the bottom right of the page, for improved usability.
