# Single Product Total for WooCommerce

The quickest and lightest way to show total price on product page.

## Description

This plugin displays total price on WooCommerce product pages. A simple and sleek design along with a wide variety of design choices. Together with an add to cart button within the total price section it becomes a very useful feature. Especially if it's displayed in floating or fixed positions. Supports all basic WooCommerce product types like simple, variable and grouped products. 

<!-- A very comprehensive admin settings page designed to maximize user comfort. -->

With new **animation duration option** users can adjust the timing to load total price. This feature is very helpful if you have a product page with lots of plugins installed. Just set a bit high loader time and it will automatically support **WooCommerce Discount Plugins**. Change it according to your site's rquirements.
