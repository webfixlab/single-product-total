# Single Product Total for WooCommerce

Enhance your product page by displaying the total product price based on the quantity selected by the customer.

## Description

Single Product Total for WooCommerce allows you to display the total price of a product on the single product page based on the selected quantity. This helps customers quickly understand the total cost of the product they want to purchase.

The plugin supports single, variable, and grouped products. It also provides extensive styling options to match your storeâ€™s design. For heavier sites, the variable price loading delay can be adjusted from the default 1 second up to 4 seconds. Additionally, an add-to-cart button can be positioned in fixed locations, such as the bottom right of the page, for improved usability.
